Clothes play a big role in our life. We wear clothes to differ from others, showing our innodividuality. Fashion is constantly changing, so everyone 
chooses his own style. And this style may be both in vogue and out of fashion. But it doesn’t matter as long as a person likes it.
We can wear whatever we want. But this rule applies only to home clothing. When we are within a society, we must adhere to some limits. 
Especially it refers to school clothes or as they s
ay – school uniform. In most countries uniforms are mandatory.
For example, in England. All girls and boys are required to wear a particular uniform. If you see a pupil attired in blue, know for sure tha
t this person comes from England. However, for the past years every school in England may change rules. Pupils are allowed to wear shorts 
(in summer) and sweaters (if it’s cold). For the most part pupils wear trousers, skirts (only girls), shirts, blouses, blazers and dresses (also for girls). Strangely enough, but boys and girls should wear a tie as well.
